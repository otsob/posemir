# Benchmarks for Point Set Repeated Pattern algorithms

This crate implements benchmarks and benchmarks utilities for point set discovery algorithms. The data sets are included
in the `benches/data` directory and can be downloaded using [DVC](https://dvc.org) with the
`gsuite`add-on.

Running the benchmarks requires setting the environment variable `BENCHMARK_DATA_PATH` to the absolute path of the
directory `benchmark/benches/data` inside this repository.
